We Got Hacked is a simulation and training game developed by the GT-IR team, part of the Hackers do Bem [Good Hackers] program, and funded by [RNP](https://www.rnp.br/) (Rede Nacional de Ensino e Pesquisa [National Education and Research Network]). For the development of the game, GT-IR works in partnership with [Atomic Rocket Entertainment](https://br.linkedin.com/company/atomic-rocket-entertainment), Unisinos university experimental game studio. The project is aimed at cybersecurity students and professionals. The game is divided into three chapters that simulate real and challenging situations in the field, such as hacker attacks, data breaches, and other critical incidents. The goal is to provide a practical and immersive experience, helping players develop essential skills to deal with digital threats.

Project Goal
-------
Our business proposal is based on a scalable model aimed at both educational institutions and technology companies. The game will be offered as a 'Software as a Service' (SaaS), with monthly fees adjusted according to the number of players, allowing schools, universities, and organizations to use the platform for the continuous training of their teams.

In addition, the project includes the use of product placement, integrating real tools and solutions from manufacturers into the game’s narrative, strengthening strategic partnerships and providing players with authentic and educational experiences.

![Entidades](https://github.com/AtomicRocketEntertainment/We-Got-Hacked/blob/main/Imagens/EntitiesNew.png)

**C.A.F.E** is a cybersecurity company founded in 2015 by a small group of former engineers in the field. Even in its early years, it became a reference in corporate security, focusing on the protection of large companies, industries, and highly targeted corporations.

**PetroCais** is an oil and gas company founded in 1982 by Pedro Corpellius, a visionary patriot determined to explore, produce, refine, and commercialize oil and its derivatives in Brazil. Its creation was driven by the desire to strengthen the national energy industry and make the country self-sufficient in meeting its energy demands.

**PetroKillers** emerged in 2017 as a small hacker server created by a group of young activists. Initially, they carried out simple attacks, such as website defacements and environmental whistleblowing. Over time, the group began to attract more experienced members, who contributed to the development of custom malware and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in corporate systems within the oil and gas sector.

Meet the Playable Characters
-------
![Personas C.A.F.E](https://github.com/AtomicRocketEntertainment/We-Got-Hacked/blob/main/Imagens/Personas%20C.A.F.E%201.0.png)
**N1:** Tiago Nogueira Vatto, 20, a university student majoring in Information Security. His daily tasks include monitoring SIEM software and providing support to the team. He is good-humored and often talks about his personal interests, such as games and anime, whenever he gets the chance. Behind an ordinary façade, he hides a desire to make a difference.

**N2:** Rafael Medina Oliveira, 29, has over a decade of professional experience in technical support and networking. His daily tasks include responding to and resolving incidents. To cope with work-related stress, he tends to create a private universe in his mind, inspired by the movies and comic books he enjoys so much.

**N3:** Eduardo Pontes Rodrigues, 34, a senior cybersecurity specialist, certified OSCP and CISM. His daily tasks include investigating and mitigating security attacks. Calm under pressure, he is reserved, which can make teamwork difficult. He does not usually speak much, and when he does, he uses short, objective sentences.

**Manager:** Raquel Garcia Hent, 43, holds an MBA in Cybersecurity. Her daily tasks include coordinating and supporting the SOC team she is responsible for. She is professional at solving problems quickly and assigning tasks; however, she has some difficulty dealing with personal conflicts, which can lead to awkward situations.

Explore the Narrative Style
-------
![Storyboards](https://github.com/AtomicRocketEntertainment/We-Got-Hacked/blob/main/Imagens/StoryboardsNew.png)

The game’s story will be told through comic-style panels, which will appear at key moments to intensify the narrative impact. Each panel will consist of a static image with a caption, and there is the possibility of adding voice narration in the future.

The game will also feature multiple-choice moments in which the player will make decisions that directly influence the course of the story. These choices will affect not only the narrative but also the game’s reputation system, represented by a stock market that reflects C.A.F.E.’s performance compared to its competitors in the market.

Learn the Story
-------
We Got Hacked will be divided into three connected scenarios that come together to form a single story. Each scenario will address a typical cybersecurity theme.

**Activist Defacement** In the first scenario, the player must coordinate the team’s actions to contain and repair the damage caused by a website defacement attack carried out by the PetroKillers group on the PetroCais website. During this situation, the player will learn fundamental incident response concepts, such as the use of website analysis tools, ticket management, and the importance of effective communication with the rest of the security team.

**Phishing and Extortion**: In the second scenario, the challenge takes place on a larger scale. PetroCais has its data encrypted by PetroKillers hackers, who demand a ransom for its return after carrying out a phishing attack. In this context, the player will be introduced to new characters—the lawyer, the public relations officer, and the communications manager—who will play key roles in resolving the incident.

**Data Breach** In the third scenario, critical information belonging to PetroCais employees is leaked online. The player must investigate the source of the breach and identify those responsible. To do so, they will be supported by a new playable character, a specialist in forensic analysis and critical incident response.

Explore the Platforms and Tools
-------
![Softwares](https://github.com/AtomicRocketEntertainment/We-Got-Hacked/blob/main/Imagens/Softwares.png)

In We Got Hacked, the player will learn how to use several tools commonly used in the day-to-day operations of a cybersecurity company. Below are some of the tools featured in the game.

**Anexus Mail:** an email reading and sending software. The player will receive several messages throughout the game’s story containing important response choices that will influence the progression of the narrative.

**Tick Task:** an incident task management software that guides the player step by step on how to handle each hacker attack situation. It works similarly to a mission board.

**SIEMtinel:** a cybersecurity software used to analyze alerts of potential hacker attacks. These alerts provide crucial information that helps the player determine whether they represent a real threat or not.

Development Status
-------
![desktop-soc](https://github.com/AtomicRocketEntertainment/We-Got-Hacked/blob/main/Imagens/SOC%203.0.png)
We Got Hacked began production in January 2025, with completion planned for December of the same year. Currently (October), we are implementing the game’s final scenario. After that, in November and December, we will carry out testing and final refinements.
